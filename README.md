# eZtunnel üêù

**eZtunnel** is a transparent eBPF-based offloading for service mesh communication designed to mitigate networking overheads in intra-node service mesh communication. The method employs an in-kernel method to bypass costly data paths, while maintaining full support for modern service mesh architectures, like Istio Ambient Mesh, and sidecar-based approaches.
